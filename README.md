# Photo-Labelling 

This script provides a Tkinter interface to select a folder containing images to apply a signature or label on them.

It is pretty quick and basic. It uses OpenCV for handling images but maybe Pillow is more suited for this. 
We worked on this project to help make easy signatures on our photographs by batch processing them.
